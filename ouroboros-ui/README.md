# ouroboros-ui

> **Status:** directory reserved — the application scaffold lands in
> [#39](https://github.com/NobuData/ouroboros/issues/39) (epic
> [#5](https://github.com/NobuData/ouroboros/issues/5)). Until then this README is the
> contract the scaffold must satisfy.

## Purpose

The **product UI** — the application users sign into, distinct from the marketing site
in [`../ouroboros-web`](../ouroboros-web). It renders the screens designed in
[`../docs/mockups`](../docs/mockups) against the app shell specified in
[`../docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM_APP_SHELL.md`](../docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM_APP_SHELL.md), with
on-the-fly light/dark theme switching.

This module talks to **`ouroboros-rest` only**. It never reaches the database or the
engine directly — that boundary is what keeps tenancy enforcement in one place.

## Stack

| Concern | Choice |
|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js (App Router), React 19 |
| Language | TypeScript 5, `strict` |
| Package manager | Yarn 4 via corepack (`nodeLinker: node-modules`) |
| Runtime | Node 24 |
| Styling | CSS custom properties (design tokens), no CSS-in-JS |
| Fonts | Chakra Petch (display), IBM Plex Sans (UI), IBM Plex Mono (data) via `next/font` |
| Tests | Vitest + Testing Library |
| Lint | ESLint flat config |
| Container | Multi-stage Dockerfile, Next.js standalone output |

## Run

```bash
yarn install    # immutable install from the committed lockfile
yarn dev        # http://localhost:3000
yarn lint
yarn typecheck
yarn test
yarn build && yarn start
```

`lint`, `typecheck`, `test` and `build` are what `ci/ui` runs on every pull request
touching this directory — see [conventions](../docs/CONVENTIONS.md#9-ci).

## Configuration

Development default port: **3000** (`PORT`).

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `PORT` | HTTP listen port (unprefixed by convention — see [conventions](../docs/CONVENTIONS.md)) |
| `OURO_REST_URL` | Base URL of `ouroboros-rest`, e.g. `http://localhost:4000` |

Copy the repo-root `.env.example` and never commit a populated `.env`.

## Favicons and the web-app manifest

[`public/`](public) already holds the browser and home-screen icon set, generated from
the brand icon pair by [`../scripts/build-favicons.py`](../scripts/build-favicons.py)
([#15](https://github.com/NobuData/ouroboros/issues/15)). It landed ahead of the scaffold
because none of it is application code — the files are static, and two of them work with
no wiring at all.

| File | Size | Transparent | For |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`public/favicon.ico`](public/favicon.ico) | 16, 32, 48 | no | The tab, the address bar, the desktop shortcut. Served at `/favicon.ico`, which every browser probes on its own |
| [`public/favicon-32-light.png`](public/favicon-32-light.png) | 32×32 | yes | The tab under light browser chrome |
| [`public/favicon-32-dark.png`](public/favicon-32-dark.png) | 32×32 | yes | The tab under dark browser chrome |
| [`public/apple-touch-icon.png`](public/apple-touch-icon.png) | 180×180 | no | The iOS home screen. Served at `/apple-touch-icon.png`, which iOS Safari probes on its own |
| [`public/icon-192.png`](public/icon-192.png) | 192×192 | no | Manifest icon — Android home screen, task switcher |
| [`public/icon-512.png`](public/icon-512.png) | 512×512 | no | Manifest icon — splash screen, install prompt |
| [`public/manifest.webmanifest`](public/manifest.webmanifest) | — | — | App name, scheme colours and the two icons above |

Why two kinds. A browser tab is a surface whose colour the page does not own, so the tab
icons are a transparent pair and the browser picks one by `prefers-color-scheme` — the
rule [`../docs/BRAND.md`](../docs/BRAND.md) sets out, that the treatment follows the
surface it sits on. A home screen is an unknown background, which the same document
answers by putting the mark on a brand-coloured panel first, so every icon a launcher
draws is flattened onto the dark ground `#12181d` and carries no alpha channel at all.

### What the scaffold still has to wire

`favicon.ico` and `apple-touch-icon.png` resolve by convention, but the theme-aware pair
and the manifest need `<link>` tags, which means the Metadata API. Add this to
`app/layout.tsx` when [#39](https://github.com/NobuData/ouroboros/issues/39) lands:

```ts
import type { Metadata, Viewport } from "next";

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  icons: {
    icon: [
      {
        url: "/favicon-32-light.png",
        type: "image/png",
        sizes: "32x32",
        media: "(prefers-color-scheme: light)",
      },
      {
        url: "/favicon-32-dark.png",
        type: "image/png",
        sizes: "32x32",
        media: "(prefers-color-scheme: dark)",
      },
    ],
    apple: { url: "/apple-touch-icon.png", sizes: "180x180" },
  },
  manifest: "/manifest.webmanifest",
};

// themeColor is a viewport export in Next 14+, not a metadata field. The manifest
// carries one colour because the format has one; the per-scheme pair lives here.
export const viewport: Viewport = {
  themeColor: [
    { media: "(prefers-color-scheme: light)", color: "#f5f8fa" },
    { media: "(prefers-color-scheme: dark)", color: "#12181d" },
  ],
};
```

Two things to leave alone. Do not add `app/favicon.ico` or `app/icon.*`: those are
Next's own file conventions and they would emit a second, competing set of `<link>` tags
alongside the ones above. And do not hand-edit anything in `public/` — regenerate:

```bash
uv run --with Pillow scripts/build-favicons.py           # rewrite ouroboros-ui/public/
uv run --with Pillow scripts/build-favicons.py --check   # still match the brand icons?
scripts/verify-favicons.sh                               # files ↔ manifest ↔ this document
```
